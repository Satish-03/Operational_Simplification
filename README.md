# Operational_Simplification

Every time when we need to navigate to a particular user on a LAN, we typically tend to do show arp then sh mac address table then sh cdp neighbors. And when user is two or three hops far away, we need to go through cli process on every device until we find that. However, we can use scripts to get this sort of information without manual login.



Stay tuned!!!!!
